Modern Minimalism,"A sleek, refined space defined by sculptural plants, white space, and minimal materials. Focused on balance, simplicity, and restraint.","A Modern Minimalism garden distills modern design to its purest form. It emphasizes sculptural simplicity, white space, and deliberate restraint in both planting and materials. With sparse, architectural elements and a limited palette, the space feels quiet and refined. Negative space is used as intentionally as the plantings, celebrating geometry, balance, and thoughtful reduction.","linear, asymmetrical, informal_hierarchy, odd_spacing, abstraction, rhythm, massing, limited_palette, white_space, restraint, sparse, sculptural
Modern Lush,"Blends modern structure with rich, dense planting. A limited palette and strong forms create rhythm and depth, achieving a lush, immersive feel without visual clutter.","A Modern Lush garden blends the clean lines and structured aesthetic of modern design with rich, textural planting.

Classical,"Emphasizes symmetry, order, and geometry with manicured lawns, sculpted shrubs, and a restrained palette. Formal structure and repetition create timeless elegance.","A Classical garden emphasizes structure, balance, and timeless elegance. Rooted in symmetry and formal hierarchy, this style features linear layouts, geometric planting patterns, and meticulously defined borders—often through evergreen hedges or hardscaping that remain present year-round. Gardens are typically curated around a formal path system that leads the eye toward focal points such as fountains, sculptures, or neatly clipped topiary. Plantings follow a limited color palette, typically favoring greens and whites, with repetition and order reinforcing a sense of calm and control. Manicured lawns, sculpted shrubs, and ornamental elements lend a sense of refinement and grandeur.","geometrical, symmetrical, formal_hierarchy, even_spacing, order, repetition, massing, limited_palette, formal, traditional"
Cottage,"A colorful, romantic garden filled with densely layered flowers and herbs. Informal and abundant, it blends ornament and utility with personal charm.","While it shares the wild charm and informality of a naturalistic garden, the Cottage garden adds a distinctly romantic and curated flair. Overflowing with color, scent, and personality, this style mixes edible and ornamental plants in a dense, layered fashion that feels spontaneous but often reflects human intention. Cottage gardens typically favor traditional favorites—roses, herbs, and self-seeding perennials—arranged in a way that suggests abundance and lived-in comfort. Unlike naturalistic gardens, which aim to mimic native ecosystems, cottage gardens lean into nostalgic beauty and personal expression, with a looser relationship to ecological function.","overflowing, layered, romantic, whimsical, nostalgic, informal, colorful, fragrant, cottagecore, natural"
Naturalistic,"A relaxed, organic garden inspired by native landscapes. Flowing plant groupings and natural materials create a vibrant, ever-changing space full of life and movement.","A Naturalistic garden embraces the untamed beauty of nature, blurring the boundary between cultivated space and wild landscape. Inspired by native ecosystems—from sun-drenched prairies to shaded woodlands—this style prioritizes biodiversity, habitat creation, and ecological harmony. Plants are arranged in loose, organic patterns that mimic natural plant communities, with clumped or scattered groupings and no formal hierarchy. Materials like stone, wood, and gravel blend seamlessly into the environment, while color, texture, and form follow the rhythms of the surrounding landscape. Whether open and airy or densely layered, naturalistic gardens evolve with the seasons and invite both people and wildlife into a living, dynamic space.","meandering, random, lack_of_hierarchy, no_spacing_rules, wild, scattered, clumped, large_palette"
Naturalistic Woodland,"Shade-loving native plants arranged in soft layers under trees. Inspired by forest floors, it feels quiet, textured, and seasonal.","Shaded and serene, the Woodland naturalistic garden draws inspiration from forest understories and dappled glades. Plantings emphasize shade-loving natives such as ferns, groundcovers, woodland grasses, and spring ephemerals, arranged in loose layers that follow the natural contours of the land. Trees and understory shrubs provide vertical structure, while mosses, leaf litter, and natural stone pathways create a grounded, organic feel. Designed to feel untouched and timeless, this garden thrives in full to partial shade and encourages seasonal shifts, from early spring blooms to the golden tones of fall.","meandering, random, lack_of_hierarchy, no_spacing_rules, wild, scattered, clumped, large_palette"
Naturalistic Prairie,"Sun-loving grasses and wildflowers arranged in natural drifts. A dynamic, low-intervention garden full of movement, color, and habitat value.","Expansive, sun-filled, and dynamic, the Prairie naturalistic garden mimics the beauty and resilience of native grasslands. Tall and short grasses—such as little bluestem or switchgrass—sway among vibrant wildflowers in irregular, intermingled groupings. Designed for full sun and open exposure, this style values movement, pollinator support, and long-season interest. Drifts of color, clumps of texture, and soft transitions between plants create a living tapestry that changes daily. Hardscaping is minimal, allowing the planting palette and the play of wind and light to take center stage.","meandering, random, lack_of_hierarchy, no_spacing_rules, wild, scattered, clumped, large_palette"
